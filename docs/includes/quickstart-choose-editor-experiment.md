Create an Office add-in using the one-line script, Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins, or Visual Studio.
- The one-line script automatically sets up your local machine's environment and launches the sample add-in project in Visual Studio Code. This bypasses the manual steps to build an add-in and takes you straight to the code, so that you can test the add-in immediately.
- The Yeoman generator creates a Node.js project that can be managed with Visual Studio Code or any other editor.
- Visual Studio creates a Visual Studio solution.
Select the tab for the option you'd like to use, then follow the instructions to create your add-in and test it locally.
